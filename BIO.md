A product designer from Oxford specialising in UX, with a BA (Hons) degree in Graphic Communications. Bringing websites to life isn't just my job — it's a labour of love.
I'm an experienced professional with a successful track record in designing projects for a diverse array of B2B and B2C clients.
Notable collaborations include work with the University of Oxford (The Kyoto Prize / 京都賞), Hitachi High-Tech, Emtez, Touch Stay, and Millar Cameron.
I'm always driven to explore the intersection of business insights with human behaviour and psychology to provide a holistic perspective on user interactions.

Here's a snapshot of my professional profile:
— Over a year of hands-on agency experience
— Proficient in equity-focused design practices
— Expertise in UX-UI toolkits such as Figma + Relume
— Skillful at aligning UX goals with overall business objectives to drive conversions

I'm always up for connecting with fellow professionals and exploring potential collaborations. Feel free to drop a message on LinkedIn or shoot me an email at:
